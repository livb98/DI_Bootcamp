// DC1
// Create two functions. Each function should return a promise.
// The first function called makeAllCaps(), takes an array of words as an argument
// If all the words in the array are strings, resolve the promise. The value of the resolved promise is the array of words uppercased.
// else, reject the promise with a reason.
// The second function called sortWords(), takes an array of words uppercased as an argument
// If the array length is bigger than 4, resolve the promise. The value of the resolved promise is the array of words sorted in alphabetical order.
// else, reject the promise with a reason.

// DC2
// Create three functions. The two first functions should return a promise..

// The first function is named toJs():
// this function converts the morse json string provided above to a morse javascript object.
// if the morse javascript object is empty, throw an error (use reject)
// else return the morse javascript object (use resolve)

// The second function called toMorse(morseJS), takes one argument: the new morse javascript object.

// This function asks the user for a word or a sentence.
// if the user entered a character that doesn’t exist in the new morse javascript object, throw an error. (use reject)

// else return an array with the morse translation of the user’s word.

// The third function called joinWords(morseTranslation), takes one argument: the morse translation array

// this function joins the morse translation by using line break and display it on the page (ie. On the DOM)

// Chain the three functions.
