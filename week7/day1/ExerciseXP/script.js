// exercise1
// Create a function called compareToTen(num) that takes a number as an argument.
// The function should return a Promise:
// the promise resolves if the argument is less than or equal to 10
// the promise rejects if argument is greater than 10.

// exercise2
// Create a promise that resolves itself in 4 seconds and returns a “success” string.

// exercise3
// Use Promise.resolve(value) to create a promise that will resolve itself with a value of 3.
// Use Promise.reject(error) to create a promise that will reject itself with the string “Boo!”
